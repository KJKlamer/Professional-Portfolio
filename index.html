    <h1>KJ Klamer</h1>
    <p style="text-align: left; font-size: large;">Hi my name is KJ Klamer and I am currently a student 
      <br><br>at Francis Howell Central Highschool and Lewis and Clark Career Center.<br><br>
      At Lewis and Clark I am in the Computer Software Development class with my teacher, 
      <br><br>Mr. Schmidt. Along with the creation of websites and little coded<br><br>
      games I've created I dabble in graphic design with the use of photoshop, lightroom 
      <br><br>and sometimes gimp. I also take photos and videos that I edit myself.<br><br>
      I along work at dierbergs and currently am a bagger there. In all, I feel like 
      <br><br>I have accomplishments but unfortuantly I have been slacking off in my <br><br>
      Lewis Class and I am trying to make up for my mistakes. 
      <br><br>I'm better than that. Thank you for taking the time to read.
    </p>
